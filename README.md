This is a development project for the Python Advanced course taught by Alexander Richter. It was created for two main reasons:
- To become familiar with Maya's API;
- To develop simple automated tasks based on suggestions from Maya users;

It will highlight all the Ngons if they were found.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For now, this feature does not have a progress bar, so keep in mind that depending on the selected 3D model (like a dense mesh), this can take some time.
