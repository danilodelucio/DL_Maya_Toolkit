**This tool is a collection of simple features to help Maya users speed up their workflows.**

___

This is a development project for the **Python Advanced** course taught by **Alexander Richter**.

I decided to create it for two main reasons:
- To become familiar with Maya's API;
- To develop simple automated tasks based on suggestions from Maya users;

Features:
- Duplicate Faces;
- Extract Faces;
- Combine Objects;
- Separate Objects;
- Outliner Renamer;
- Check Ngons;

___
  # :ice_cube: Duplicate/Extract Faces | Combine/Separate Objects
  These features are similar to the default ones in Maya, with a few differences:
  - No history;
  - Moving the 3D Pivot to the center of the object/face;

___
# :memo: Outliner Renamer
This feature allows you to rename multiple selected items in the Outliner panel.
Optionally, you can add padding by using "#", which will be replaced by sequence numbers.
> The increment value will be used if the padding is provided.

___
# :white_check_mark: Check Ngons
It will highlight all the Ngons if they were found.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For now, this feature does not have a progress bar, so keep in mind that this process can take some time depending on the selected 3D model, such as a dense mesh.
